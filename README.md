I will show you how you can create your personal text summarizer using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.

I used the text from a news article entitled Apple Acquires AI Startup For $50 Million To Advance Its Apps.

You can find the original news article here: https://analyticsindiamag.com/apple-acquires-ai-startup-for-50-million-to-advance-its-apps/

Below is the workflow that we will be followingâ€¦

**_import text>> >> clean text and split into sentences >> remove stop words >> build word histogram>> rank sentences>> select top N sentences for summary_**
